# Matrix-operations
# 1 PROJECT TITLE: MATRIX OPERATIONS

This program is a comprehensive matrix operations tool implemented in C. 
It can perform various mathematical operations on matrices,including addition,
subtraction,multipilcation,determinant calculation,transposition,trace computation,
cofactor,adjoint, and inversion.
The results of these operations are stored in external file for review.


# FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM:
 ADDITION
 SUBTRACTION
 MUTIPLICATION
 COFACTOR
 INVERSE 
 ADJOINT
 TRACE
 TRANSPOSE
 DETERMINANT
 FILE BASED INPUT AND OUTPUT

# In this code some of the major c concepts are used such as
   #  Pointers
   #  Functions
   #  Files
   #  user defined functions
   #  strings

#INPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
  SINGLE MATRIX OPERATIONS:
  D: Determinant
  T: Transpose
  t: trace
  C: cofactor
  A: adjoint
  I: inverse
 TWO MATRIX OPERATIONS:
  +: Addition of two matrices
  -: Subtraction of matrices
  *: Multiply the matrices

# FILE MANAGEMENT:
Various files are created 
1. matrix1: stores the elements of the first matrix
2. matrix2: stores the elements of the second matrix
3. result: stores the elements of the result of the operation performed.

# Error Handling
Ensures valid dimensions for operations:
*Addition and subtraction: Dimensions of both matrices must match.
*Multiplication: Number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.
*Determinant, trace, cofactor, adjoint, and inverse: Only applicable to square matrices.

Handles file-opening errors with descriptive messages.
Validates user inputs to prevent undefined behaviors.

# CODE STRUCTURE:
* the main functions usually operates all the applications 
or the operations that should be performed.
* the helper functions such as dterminant, findadjoint,traceofmatrix
performs a specific operation as guided by the main function.
